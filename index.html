            Introduction
            <h3>
                My name is Gabe Carlson. I am the youngest of 5 and self proclaimed favorite. 
                I grew up in Monee, IL on a little hobby farm, which is about 45 minutes from Lewis University.
                My siblings and I grew up riding horses, raising chickens, growing gardens, and fishing in our back yard.
                I am a Computer Science major that has no idea what kind of concentration to go into.

            My Favorite Hobby
            <h3>
                Downhill skiing is my all time favorite hobby. 
                It may be an expinsive hobby, but the joys, experiences, and memories that I have gotten from skiing have been amazing.
                I was so young when I first started skiing that I don't remember the first time I skied.
                For the past couple of years, I have been able to travel out west and ski the Rockies.
                This has made winter my favorite season, and it isn't even close.
